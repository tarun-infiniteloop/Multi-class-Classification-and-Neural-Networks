# Multi-class-Classification-and-Neural-Networks

In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
Files needed for this exercise - 

1. ex3.mlx - MATLAB Live Script that steps you through the exercise
2. ex3data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits
3. ex3weights.mat - Initial weights for the neural network exercise
4. displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset
5. fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)
6. sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function
7. *lrCostFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function
8. *oneVsAll.m - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier
9. *predictOneVsAll.m - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier
10. *predict.m - Neural network prediction function
